<p>I am a mechatronics student who enjoys all things opensource. I enjoy the development of producing small embedded systems. I am a keen hobbyist and have spent time working on bringing AOSP to a series of Xperia devices. Most of my time is taken up with university although there is still plenty of time to fit in the occasional Android build.</p>

<p>As mentioned the majority of my time is presently taken up with the completion of my university degree in Mechatronics. However, when I'm not doing that my spare time is generally taken up in working on small scale projects using Arduino, RaspberryPi and Udoo. Most these projects are for teaching myself about certain aspects of technology whilst also trying to develop a more futuristic home setting. </p>

<p>On top of this I like to take part in developing AOSP for the Xperia line of devices and made steps to bringing CM10 to the Xperia X10 (first functional build) and then producing early Alpha builds for the S, Z and Z2 devices. I also have a OnePlus One which is a very nice device for those wanting to hack away and produce something of their own. I currently build unofficial builds of AOSPA 5.0 for the OnePlus One available.</p>
